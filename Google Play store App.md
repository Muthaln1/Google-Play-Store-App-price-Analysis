## Introduction:

+ I am conducting a price analysis of Google play store Apps

+ As a part of google analytics team, I am trying to prototype a project to investigate whether it is profitable enough to secure funding, allowing decision makers to invest time and resources

## Assumption:
+ We assume the account manager approaches us to prototype the project, considering that the department's  marketing budget does not allow her to invest in ads (which would boost sales). The only way to improve the revenue is by adjusting the price

## GOAL:
+ To improve the revenue of undervalued apps in the paid category and motivate developers to continue working on them
+ To determine which paid apps are undervalued (here, "undervalued" means that their price could be increased without lowering demand)

#### Loading the data into Pandas dataframe:

```python
import pandas as pd

playstore = pd.read_csv("googleplaystore.csv")

# There were totally 10841 rows and 13 columns
print(playstore.shape)
```

    (10841, 13)


#### Sample data


```python
print(playstore.head(1))
```

### Google play store data contains:
`App`: The name of the App


`Category`: The category of the app, which contains 33 different categories


`Rating`: The user generated scores ranging between 1-5 stars


`Reviews`: The number of feedback entries generated by users for the app


`Size`: The amount of storage space the app requires on a user's device. It is measured in megabytes (MB) and Kilobytes (KB) 


`Installs`: The number of times an app has been downloaded and installed by users on their devices


`Type`: The type of an app whether it is free or paid


`Price`: The cost that users must pay to download


`Content Rating`: The target audience based on age suitability


`Genres`: The genre of an app to understand its primary function


`Last Updated`: The last date the app was last modified or improved by the developers


`Current Ver`: The current version of an app


`Android Ver`: The Android version of an app


## Findings:

+ The 'Rating' field ranges between 0 and 5, but there was a presence of 19.0, indicating that there are outliers in the data


+ Upon inspecting the 'Category' field, which is of object data type, we found the presence of integer values


+ There was a column shifting of data in one of the rows with index 10472, moving data from the 'Rating' field to the 'Category' field


+ We used the Google Play Store to obtain the actual category to fill in the data, which is LIFESTYLE


+ As our project is focused on paid apps, we could drop the problematic row with index 10472, as it pertains to a free app


+ There are totally 10039 free apps priced 0.00 as showed below and 800 paid apps

## Findings:
+ There is duplicate data in the `App` field. This is due to the presence of the `Reviews` and `Category` fields
+ Some apps are categorized under both Game and Family.
+ The reviews are collected at different points in time, and we should keep the highest review for each app, as it indicates the most current data.

### Apps Categorized Under Two Categories with Multiple Reviews, Causing Duplication


```python
# sampling some of the duplicate rows from the Actual dataframe 'playstore':
# Multiple category

print(playstore[playstore['App'] == 'ROBLOX'][['App','Category','Reviews']].sort_values(by ='Reviews', ascending = False ))
```

print("Number of rows before dropping duplicates: {}".format(paid.shape[0]))

# Remove duplicates but leaves the first occurence
paid.drop_duplicates(subset="App",inplace=True)

print("Number of rows after dropping duplicates: {}".format(paid.shape[0]))
```

    Number of rows before dropping duplicates: 800
    Number of rows after dropping duplicates: 756



```python
# Checking the presence of duplicate values

print('Duplicate Values:' ,paid.duplicated(subset="App").sum())
```

    Duplicate Values: 0


### Findings:

+ The distribution of App prices is right-skewed, with most prices falling below 50 dollars.
+ We will remove the outliers and focus on rows where the price is 50 dollars or below for better analysis.


```python
paid.hist(column="Price", grid=False, figsize=(10,6))
```




    array([[<Axes: title={'center': 'Price'}>]], dtype=object)

#### Paid App - Minimum price 
```python
print(paid['Price'].min())
```

    0.99


### Segmenting the data

+ Due to the presence of outliers, I am curating the data into the affordable_apps DataFrame so that the price range of apps is between a minimum of 0.99 cents and a maximum of 50 dollars.


```python
#Segmenting the data further and dividing the dataframe from 'paid' to 'affordable_apps'
# Rows reduced from 800 to 733

affordable_apps = paid[paid['Price']<= 50]
print(affordable_apps.shape[0])
```

    733

## Findings: 

+ The distribution of prices in the affordable apps dataframe is still skewed to the right, with many apps falling within the price range of $0 to $10


```python
# Histogram to visualize the distribution of the dataframe

affordable_apps.hist(column="Price", grid=False, figsize=(12,6))
```

### Segmenting the data using App price

### Findings:
+ Out of the 733 apps, 596 are considered cheap, 121 are categorized as reasonable, and 16 are classified as expensive.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Creating masks to obtain data based on the condition provided:
cheap = affordable_apps['Price'] < 5

reasonable = (affordable_apps['Price'] >= 5) & (affordable_apps['Price'] <= 20)

expensive = affordable_apps['Price'] > 20
```


```python
# Cheaper Apps price distribution:
affordable_apps[cheap].hist(column = 'Price',grid=False,figsize=(6,6))
plt.title('Price Distribution of Cheaper Apps')
plt.xlabel('Price') 
plt.ylabel('Frequency') 
plt.show()
```

plt.title('Price Distribution of Resonable Apps') 
plt.xlabel('Price')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Frequency')  # Label for the y-axis
plt.show()
```

plt.ylabel('Frequency')  # Label for the y-axis
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_50_0.png)
    


#### Adding an  `affordability ` field to determine whether the App is cheap, reasonable or expensive


```python
# Function to add a column to segment the data into cheaper and resonable apps:
# There were totally 596 apps cost less than 5$(Cheaper) and 137 apps that costs above 5$(Reasonable)

def cheaper(x):
        if x['Price'] < 5:
            return 'cheap'
        elif x['Price'] <= 20:
            return 'reasonable'
        else:
            return 'expensive'
    
affordable_apps['affordability'] = affordable_apps.apply(cheaper, axis =1)

```

      affordable_apps['affordability'] = affordable_apps.apply(cheaper, axis =1)


#### The affordable_apps dataframe consists of 596 apps that cost less than 5 dollars, 121 apps priced between 5 and 20 dollars, and 16 apps priced above 20 dollars.


```python
print(affordable_apps['affordability'].value_counts())
```

    cheap         596
    reasonable    121

### Findings:

+ There is no meaningful relationship between price and rating that could help us adjust the price without impacting the app's ratings. 

+ The correlation between price and rating is -0.0499, which is quite low.


```python
print(affordable_apps[['Price','Rating']].corr())
```

               Price    Rating
    Price   1.000000 -0.049897

### Goals:

I have curated 733 apps for prototyping the project, and the new goals are as follows:

+ To determine the new prices for apps that are undervalued.

+ To use the `affordability`,`Price`,`Genre`,`Category`,`Installs` and `Reviews` fields to establish success criteria for implementing the new price changes

### Price:
+ To determine the mean price of each affordability group and compare them within their respective groups to identify undervalued apps

+ To flag the apps that meet the above conditions in order to count the number of apps with price adjustment opportunities

+ To create a new price column for the undervalued apps, assigning them their respective mean prices.

### Findings:
+ There are 386 apps priced below the mean price of their respective groups, indicating an opportunity for price adjustments


#### The initial mean prices for the respective groups are:

 + Cheap: 2.58
 + Reasonable: 9.88
 + Expensive: 31.86

#### The new mean prices for the respective groups are:
 + Cheap: 3.16
 + Reasonable: 11.56
 + Expensive: 34.34


```python
# Considering the affordability group to determine the mean price:
aff_mean_test = affordable_apps.groupby(['affordability']).mean()[['Price']]

print(aff_mean_test)
```

                       Price
    affordability           
    cheap           2.580319
    expensive      31.865000
    reasonable      9.881240

In a future version, numeric_only will default to False. Either specify numeric_only or select only columns which should be valid for the function.
      aff_mean_test = affordable_apps.groupby(['affordability']).mean()[['Price']]


### Price Criteria


```python
# Function to identify apps that have price below the group mean price - Cheap, Reasonable and Expensive
def price_criteriaa(x):
    aff = x['affordability']
    pri = x['Price']
    if pri < aff_mean_test.loc[aff].values[0]:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

affordable_apps['price_criterion'] = affordable_apps.apply(price_criteriaa,axis =1)

### Genre criteria: 

+ To determine the mean price of affordable apps grouped by genre and compare them with their respective mean prices to identify undervalued apps

+ Apps with more than one genres should provide greater visibility to the audience leading to more downloads

### Findings:
+ There are 425 apps priced below their mean price based on the affordability & genre criteria

+ Out of 773 apps, 70 are tagged under multiple genres, while 663 are tagged under a single genre

#### The new mean price based on the genre and affordability criteria is as follows: 

+ cheap:      3.071
+ expensive:  33.15
+ reasonable: 11.057

# Due to the split,we have 'None' values in our columns. Replacing them with nan using numpy:
affordable_apps['Genres_2'].replace({None: np.nan}, inplace=True)

#Filling the nan values in Genres_2 columns with values from Genres_1:
affordable_apps['Genres_2'].fillna(affordable_apps['Genres_1'], inplace = True)

### Average_price: 

+ Using the provided prices, we have obtained the new prices based on three criteria: affordability, genre, and category

+ Each category provides mean prices based on its respective groups

+ We will obtain the mean price of all these criterias to determine the new prices for our undervalued apps

### Findings: 

+ The new price we have set for our undervalued apps shows us we have an opportunity to create value for our business

+ Out of 773 paid Apps, 466 apps have undergone a price change.

+ The analysis shows we could gain a net worth of 83 millon dollars 

#### Mean of all criteria prices, which will become the new prices for our undervalued apps:


```python
affordable_apps['avg_price'] = round((affordable_apps['New Price'] + affordable_apps['New Price_categ'] + affordable_apps['New Price_genre']) / 3,2)
```


```python
# Out of 733 paid apps, We have totally 466 Apps has new/updated price.

App_price_change = affordable_apps[affordable_apps['Price']!= affordable_apps['avg_price']]

print('Number of Apps that went through price change:',App_price_change['App'].count())
```

    Number of Apps that went through price change: 466


#### To determine the Impact created we use the below formula:

Impact = (New price - Old price) * No of Installs


```python
# Using the new price and no of installs to determine the impact we could create for individual apps:

affordable_apps['Impact_avg'] = (affordable_apps['avg_price'] - affordable_apps['Price']) *  affordable_apps['Installs']

print(affordable_apps['Impact_avg'].head())
```

    2241    36200000.0

### More analysis: ### Rating vs Installs Vs Reviews:

### Findings:

+ The number of 'Installs' has a relationship with 'Reviews' having a high Correlation of (0.807499)

+ The higher the reviews, the more the installation for both cheap and reasonable apps

+ The distribution of ratings is heavily skewed to the left 

+ Out of 773 paid apps we are working on, 712 Apps has ratings above 3.0

+ Out of 773 paid apps we are working on, 459 Apps has installations above 1000


```python
print(affordable_apps[['Reviews','Installs']].corr())

               Reviews  Installs
    Reviews   1.000000  0.807499
    Installs  0.807499  1.000000



```python
# Reviews are more for cheaper Apps with single genre and reasonable apps with multi genre leading to more Installs:
